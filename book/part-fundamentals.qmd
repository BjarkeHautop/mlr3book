# Part I: Fundamentals

{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

In this part of the book we are going to teach you the fundamentals of `mlr3`.
This will give you a flavour of the building blocks of the `mlr3` universe and the basics tools you will need to tackle most machine learning problems.

In @sec-basics we will cover the basic classes in `r mlr3`, including `Learner` (machine learning implementations), `Measure` (performance metrics), and `Task` (machine learning task definitions).

@sec-performance will take evaluation a step further to include discussions about resampling -- robust strategies for measuring model performance -- and benchmarking -- experiments for comparing multiple models.

#| fig-alt: "A flowchart-like diagram with 3 overlapping boxes. Left box has the caption 'Data splitting / resampling process', upper right box has caption 'Learning process', and lower right box has caption 'Evaluation process'. The process starts in the left box with 'Data' and an arrow to 'Resampling Strategy', which bifurcates into two elements stacked vertically: 'Train Set(s)' above and 'Test Set(s)' below. The 'Train set(s)' element leads to a large blue box with the caption 'Learning process'. There, the 'Train set(s)' flows into the Learner, together with 'Hyperparameters'. An arrow points from the 'Learner' to a stack of 'Intermediate Model(s)'. One thick arrow goes down into the yellow box to a stack of 'Prediction(s)'. And arrow goes from there to 'Performance measure'. The 'Test set(s)' from earlier also have an arrow to 'Performance measure'. From there, a thick arrow goes to 'Performance Value(s)', which has a final dashed arrow to 'Aggregated Performance'."
